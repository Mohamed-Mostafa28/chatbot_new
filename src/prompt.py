### Key Enhancements:
# 1. **Clearer Sections**: Divided into well-defined subcategories (current, stopped, past activities, and injuries).
# 2. **Logical Flow**: It begins with current activities, then moves to past or stopped activities, and finishes with health-related questions (injuries or pain).
# 3. **Natural Phrasing**: The questions sound conversational yet professional, ensuring that the flow makes sense when the chatbot asks them.
# 4. **Injury/Pain Detail**: Specifically asks how injuries or pain impacted the person’s participation, which is relevant to understanding long-term physical health.
